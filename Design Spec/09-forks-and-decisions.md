# Forks & Decisions

Agency is the difference between "I did what I had to" and "I chose this." This document defines where agency lives in the game.

## The Three Scales of Decision

### Daily Forks — What Do We Do Today?

These are small, constant, and cumulative. No single daily decision is game-defining, but the pattern of daily decisions shapes the run.

**MW Assignment:**
- Explore Ring 1 for clues? Or Ring 2 for deeper discoveries?
- Scout the incoming threat? Or rescue the priest lost yesterday?
- Investigate that known location? Or keep exploring for new clues?

**Labor Allocation:**
- Put the engineer on traps (defense now) or digging (discovery later)?
- Keep the scholar decoding clues or assign them to forecast threats?
- Send a worker to farm food or assist the dig?

**Daily forks serve:** Efficiency, Agency

### Strategic Forks — What Kind of Monastery Are We?

These are infrequent, permanent, and identity-defining. They shape the run.

**Mist Walker Commitment:**
Making someone a Mist Walker is irreversible. That person will never be a soldier, priest, or scholar. When do you make a second MW? Who do you sacrifice from the roster?

**Elevation Specialization:**
When a character reaches Elevated tier, the player chooses a specialization. A scholar becoming an Alchemist is a scholar who will NEVER be a Cartographer. This shapes what the monastery can do.

**Ring Advancement:**
Pushing into a deeper ring is a strategic commitment. The mist will escalate. New threats will appear. There's no going back to the safety of Ring 1 once Ring 2 threats are active.

**Resource Investment:**
Building an alchemy lab means NOT building a forge. Digging east means NOT digging west. Infrastructure choices are permanent and define the monastery's capabilities.

**Strategic forks serve:** Agency, Comprehension, Attachment

### Existential Forks — Do We Commit?

These are rare, high-stakes, and potentially run-ending. They define whether you win or die.

**The Final Push:**
Do we have enough knowledge about the source? Our scholars decoded 4 of 6 weaknesses. Do we go now while we're strong, or wait and risk the mist scaling further? This is the ultimate gamble.

**Resurrection:**
Someone critical died. We CAN bring them back — but it will drain sacred bandwidth for days, weakening the perimeter. Is it worth the risk? Who do we let stay dead?

**Desperate Expedition:**
A sealed mystery in the dependency drawer requires something from a Ring 3 location. Our priests aren't fully prepared for Ring 3. Do we send the team anyway?

**Sacrifice:**
The mist is about to breach. The only way to hold the perimeter is to pull the MW back from a critical exploration. Do we lose the discovery to save the base? Or gamble that the base holds?

**Existential forks serve:** Tension, Agency, Attachment

## Fork Design Rules

1. **Both options must have real value.** If one choice is obviously correct, it's not a fork — it's a task. The player must genuinely struggle.

2. **Both options must have real cost.** Choosing A means losing B. If there's no cost, there's no decision.

3. **The consequences must be legible.** The player should be able to reason about what will happen. Uncertainty is fine; randomness without context is not.

4. **Forks should connect to the six words.** Every major decision should engage at least two of: Comprehension, Wonder, Efficiency, Agency, Attachment, Tension.

5. **Some forks should be emergent.** Not every fork is designed. Some arise from the collision of systems — the MW found something amazing on the same day a raid is incoming. What do you do? These are the best forks because they feel organic, not scripted.

## Open Questions

- How do we ensure daily forks feel meaningful and not routine?
- Should the game explicitly present strategic forks ("Choose Alchemist or Herbalist") or let them emerge from context?
- How many existential forks should a typical run contain?
- Can some forks be avoided entirely? (Is avoiding a decision itself a decision?)
- Should the game track and display key decisions the player made (a "choices log")?
