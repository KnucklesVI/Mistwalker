# Wonder & Identity

Wonder is not a feature. It is a delivery system for emotion. It's what makes the player remember THIS run, THIS monastery, THIS person.

## The Event Hierarchy

Not all events are created equal. The game needs a clear hierarchy so that routine noise doesn't drown out life-changing moments.

### Routine Events
The daily feed. Worker finished farming. Soldier completed training. Scholar is 50% through decoding. These are informational. They scroll by. They're the monastery's heartbeat.

### Notable Events
Something worth pausing for. A raid is incoming. Someone was injured. A dig broke through to a new level. The perimeter dropped below a threshold. These demand attention but not awe.

### Mythic Events
Full-screen interrupts. The game pauses. The screen changes. Something permanent just happened. These are rare — maybe 5-8 per run. They are the moments the player remembers.

**Mythic Event triggers include:**
- First resurrection
- First tome binding
- First time a new mist element appears
- First time a sealed mystery is unlocked
- A major underground discovery (ancient facility, forbidden chamber)
- A character undergoing a non-standard transformation
- A critical clue about the source being decoded
- The decision to push into a new ring

Mythic Events should feel like chapter breaks. They change what the monastery IS.

## Character Identity

Characters are not stat blocks. They are people with histories.

### The Naming System

Characters start with simple names. As they experience major events, their names grow — Gandalf-style.

**Progression:**
- **Novice:** Simple name. *Brother Hal. Sister Wren.*
- **Veteran:** Role acknowledged. *Hal the Steadfast. Wren of the Perimeter.*
- **Elevated + Specialized:** Specialization in name. *Hal, Siege Breaker. Wren, Keeper of the Veil.*
- **Mythic transformation:** History encoded. *Hal, Who Returned from the Deep. Wren, First of the Reborn.*

Names do NOT change mechanics. They reflect what has already happened. They store memory. They are a narrative XP bar.

### What Makes a Character Unique

A late-game character is defined by:
1. **Base role** — Priest, Soldier, etc.
2. **Experience tier** — Novice, Veteran, Elevated
3. **Specialization** — Chosen path (if elevated)
4. **Lived history** — Non-standard transformations, scars, bindings, titles

No two characters with the same role will feel the same by mid-game. Their histories diverge through what they survived, what they were assigned to, and what happened to them.

### Attachment Through Irreplaceability

A veteran priest who has been transformed into a corruption specialist, bound to a specific tome, and carries the scar of being lost in the mist for 3 days — that person is irreplaceable. Not because their stats are high, but because their combination of capabilities is unique to THIS run.

Losing them isn't just losing a number. It's losing a configuration that cannot be rebuilt.

THAT is attachment.

## Wonder Through Discovery

Discoveries should change how the player THINKS, not just what numbers they have.

**Good discovery:** "You found the Tome of Buried Flame. Your elevated priest can now bind to it, gaining the ability to project protective fire into the mist — but the binding permanently reduces their prayer output by 20%."

**Bad discovery:** "You found a scroll. +5% perimeter stability."

The good discovery creates a fork (do I bind?), changes identity (this priest becomes the Flamekeeper), introduces a tradeoff (power vs bandwidth), and is memorable.

The bad discovery is forgotten immediately.

Every discovery in the game should aspire to the first pattern.

## Legacy — The Essence System

When a character dies, something remains — if the body is recovered. This is the **essence**, the accumulated identity of a person who lived, fought, and mattered.

### Body Recovery

If a character dies and their body can be brought back to the monastery, their essence is preserved. If the body is lost — consumed by the mist, left behind on a failed expedition, destroyed in an underground collapse — the essence is gone forever.

This makes body recovery a real decision during expeditions. If a team member falls, the surviving members must choose: bring the body back (slower, heavier, more dangerous return trip) or leave it (faster retreat, essence lost). This is a fork with weight — especially for veteran and elevated characters whose essence is enormously valuable.

### Two Paths for a Preserved Essence

A preserved essence creates a **fork**. The player must choose one:

**Resurrection.** An Oathkeeper (or any priest, but Oathkeeper is faster and cleaner) performs the rite. The character returns with their frozen progress — role, tier, specialization, history intact. But resurrection has side effects: the character may come back changed. Altered stats, new fears, unusual capabilities, a different relationship with the mist. The person who returns is the same person, but not unchanged. Resurrection also draws Source Attention — bringing someone back from death is exactly the kind of powerful act the Source notices.

**Repurpose.** Instead of resurrection, the essence is used for something else. It cannot be undone — the character is truly gone, but their accumulated identity feeds into the monastery in a different way:

- **Essence Binding** — Infuse the essence into a living character. The recipient gains a permanent stat boost or a partial trait from the dead character. A scholar who absorbs a veteran soldier's essence might gain unusual physical resilience. The dead live on in the living.
- **Essence Offering** — Feed the essence to a facility or the perimeter. Temporary but powerful effect: a burst of sacred bandwidth, an acceleration of research, a fortification of the wall. The monastery drinks what the person was.
- **Essence Crafting** — Use the essence as a component in high-tier recipes. The most powerful items in the game require essence as a material. This is the most utilitarian path and the hardest to choose emotionally.
- **Memory Imprint** — A scholar studies the essence, unlocking knowledge the dead character had witnessed but hadn't yet reported or decoded. Particularly valuable for MWs or scholars who died with undecoded observations. What they saw in their final moments might contain critical intelligence.

### The Design Intent

The Essence system serves **Attachment** (death is meaningful because what remains is valuable), **Agency** (the player chooses what to do with loss), and **Tension** (body recovery is a risk, and the resurrection-vs-repurpose fork has no easy answer).

It also prevents death from being purely negative. Losing a veteran is devastating, but their essence creates new possibilities. The monastery that suffers loss can still find meaning in it — not as consolation, but as a genuine strategic option.

## Open Questions

- [ ] How many mythic events should a typical run contain?
- [ ] Should mythic events have mechanical consequences, or purely narrative + transformation?
- [ ] How are character names generated? Fixed pool? Procedural? Cultural theme?
- [ ] Can a character accumulate unlimited non-standard traits, or is there a cap?
- [ ] Should the player name characters, or are names always generated?
- [ ] How do we handle attachment when characters die early before accumulating history?
- [ ] What specific resurrection side effects exist? (Pool of possible changes)
- [ ] How strong are essence binding stat boosts? Enough to matter, or marginal?
- [ ] Do essence offerings have fixed effects or scale with the character's tier/history?
- [ ] Can essence be stored indefinitely, or does it degrade over time?
