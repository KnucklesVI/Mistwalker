# A Day in the Life

Concrete gameplay scenarios showing how systems collide in practice. If a mechanic can't survive contact with a real day, it doesn't belong in the spec.

## Day 1 — The First Morning (Phase 1: Survival Funnel)

You have 20 people. The perimeter is at 68% and dropping. The mist is physical — standard, but relentless. The feed reads:

> *"The perimeter wavers. Brother Hal reports movement in the shallows. Sister Wren prays, but the mist presses closer."*

**Your roster (starting example — exact composition TBD):**
- 4 Priests (all novice)
- 3 Soldiers (all novice)
- 2 Engineers (all novice)
- 6 Workers (all novice)
- 3 Scholars (all novice)
- 2 Unassigned

**Your immediate problem:** The perimeter needs at least 3 priests to stabilize above 80%. You have 4, but one is injured from the opening event. Three priests on the perimeter gives you ~82%. Safe enough. But that leaves only one priest available for anything else — and you'll need a priest bubble for any expedition into the mist.

**Your first real decision:** The 2 unassigned people. They can become anything, but once they start training in a role, switching costs time. Do you:
- Make one a 5th priest (perimeter insurance, but you're already stable)
- Make one a 4th soldier (raids are coming — the scholars predict something within 5 days)
- Make one a Mist Walker (you NEED perception to start the knowledge pipeline — but this is permanent and they'll be a novice for a while)

None of these is obviously correct. That's the point.

**You choose:** One becomes a Mist Walker. You name the moment. Brother Kael steps into the mist for the first time. He is gone for the day. He cannot come back until tomorrow. Your base is now 19 effective people.

**Meanwhile:** You assign Scholar Wren to decode the single clue you found in the monastery's archive. It will take 2-3 days. You assign workers to food production — you have about 8 days of food. Engineers begin surveying for a dig site. Soldiers train.

**End of day feed:**
> *Routine: Workers harvested 12 food. Engineer Torrin identified dig site beneath the east cloister.*
> *Routine: Scholar Wren began decoding Archive Fragment #1. Estimated: 2 days.*
> *Notable: Kael, the Mist Walker, perceives faint traces in Ring 1. Something was here recently. (+1 unidentified clue)*

**What the player feels:** Tense. Every person matters. The MW commitment felt heavy. Tomorrow Kael returns with a clue, and you have to decide — send him right back out, or scout for the predicted raid?

---

## Day 12 — The First Real Choice (Phase 1 → Phase 2 Transition)

Twelve days in. The perimeter is at 88%. You've survived two small raids. One soldier was injured — he'll be out for 3 days. Kael the Mist Walker has found 4 clues. Scholar Wren decoded 2 of them and is working on the third. When the third decodes, it will reveal a location in Ring 1.

**Today's problem:** Kael returns from exploration and reports something new:

> *Notable: Kael perceives a human presence in the shallow mist. Someone is alive out there. Lost. Fading.*

A rescue mission. If you send Kael tomorrow, he can probably find them. That's a potential 21st member of the monastery — incredibly valuable. But tomorrow is also the day Scholar Wren finishes decoding the third clue, which would reveal a location. If you send Kael to the location immediately, you might find a tome or a facility blueprint. You can't do both — MW gets one action per day.

**Meanwhile:** The scholars are forecasting something. It's vague — they need more data — but the pattern suggests the mist will introduce a new element within 15-20 days. Your priests can handle physical mist. They cannot handle what's coming.

**Your strategic fork:** Do you:
- Rescue the lost person (21st member, could be any role, but you're gambling on who they are)
- Investigate the newly revealed location (guaranteed discovery, feeds the knowledge pipeline)
- Scout the perimeter (the forecast is worrying — more data now means more preparation time)

**You choose rescue.** Kael goes into the mist. The day passes.

> *Notable: Kael found the lost wanderer. Sister Maren, a herbalist from a destroyed settlement. She is weak but alive. She can work in 3 days.*
> *Routine: Scholar Wren decoded Clue #3. Location revealed: The Broken Cistern (Ring 1).*

Now you have a 21st person AND a decoded location. Tomorrow: investigate The Broken Cistern, or keep exploring for more clues?

**What the player feels:** Rewarded for the rescue gamble. Cautiously optimistic. But that mist forecast is ticking in the back of their mind.

## Day 38 — The Epistemic War Begins (Phase 3)

The monastery has changed. Three of your people are veterans now — Sister Wren the Scholar, Brother Hal the Priest, and Kael the Mist Walker. Their names reflect this: *Wren of the Archive. Hal the Steadfast. Kael, Who Walks Between.*

You elevated Scholar Wren last week. You chose Alchemist over Cartographer. This was agonizing — the Cartographer would have sped up location discovery. But the Alchemist can create corruption compounds, and the mist forecast says corrupt elements arrive in 8 days.

**Today's crisis:** Three things happen at once.

> *Notable: Scholars forecast confirms — Corrupt Mist in 7 days. Current priests CANNOT counter corruption. Perimeter will degrade to ~55% without adaptation.*
> *Notable: Dig team broke through to Level 2. Chamber discovered: The Sealed Archive. Contents unknown — requires Scholar with Cartographer specialization to interpret. Sealed in Dependency Drawer.*
> *Mythic Event: Kael, exploring Ring 2 for the first time, perceives something vast. The mist here has texture. Color. Intelligence. Kael returns shaken but carrying: Tome of Buried Flame.*

The mythic event freezes the screen. New text. Different visual treatment. This is a chapter break.

The Tome of Buried Flame can be bound to an elevated priest, giving them the ability to counter corrupt mist — but the binding permanently reduces their prayer output by 20%. You need this to survive the corruption wave. But you only have one elevated priest (Hal), and reducing his prayer output means the perimeter weakens.

**Your forks, all at once:**
1. Bind the Tome to Hal? (Solves corruption but weakens base perimeter)
2. Wren the Alchemist can create corruption compounds as a temporary fix — but needs 3 corpse essences and 2 spirit herbs. You have 1 of each. Do you send an expedition for materials?
3. The Sealed Archive is in the dependency drawer — it needs a Cartographer, which you DON'T have because you chose Alchemist. Do you try to elevate a second scholar, or accept that this mystery waits?

**What the player feels:** "I know what I'm building. I hope it's enough." The monastery has a clear identity now. Choices made 20 days ago are paying off or coming due. The dependency drawer is a reminder that the path not taken still has value.

## Day 71 — The Commitment (Phase 4)

You know 4 of the source's 6 weaknesses. Scholar Wren believes the fifth is related to something in Ring 3 — but Ring 3 is the Ethereal zone, and your expedition team barely survived Ring 2. The mist clock is getting loud. Ethereal elements are starting to bleed through. You have maybe 15 days before the perimeter becomes unmanageable.

**The question the game has been building toward:** Do you go now?

> *Scholar Wren's assessment: "We understand the source's physical and corrupt defenses. Two aspects remain unknown. I believe one is sealed in the Whispering Fault — Ring 3. The other... I cannot determine without more data. Confidence in current preparation: moderate."*

Four of your 22 people have died this run. Two soldiers, one worker, one scholar. Each death hurt because each was irreplaceable. Your second scholar — the one who was going to become a Cartographer — died on an expedition in Ring 2. The sealed archive still sits in the dependency drawer. It will likely stay sealed.

**Your final fork:**
- Assault the source now with 4/6 knowledge (risky but the mist won't get worse)
- Send a desperate expedition to Ring 3 for the 5th weakness (risky, might lose more people, but 5/6 is much better odds)
- Wait and research (the mist will escalate, but Wren might decode the 6th weakness from existing data)

**You choose the expedition.** You send Kael, Hal, your best soldier, and one engineer. That's 4 people out of 22 gone for multiple days. The base is now running on 18 people. The perimeter is barely covered. If a raid hits now, it will be devastating.

Three days pass. You hold your breath.

> *Notable: Expedition returns. Kael is injured. Soldier Marcus is dead. They carry: Fragment of the Ethereal Key. Scholar Wren can decode this to reveal the 5th weakness.*

Marcus is dead. He was a veteran soldier, your best defender. His name was *Marcus the Unbroken* — and now he's gone. But you have the fragment. If Wren can decode it in time, you'll have 5/6 weaknesses mapped.

**What the player feels:** "This is it. Whatever happens, I chose this." Every loss was traceable to a decision. Every gain was earned. The final assault is next.

## What These Scenarios Reveal

These aren't just stories. They're system stress tests. Each day demonstrates:

**Day 1** tests: Role assignment as a meaningful fork. MW commitment weight. The fundamental labor scarcity.

**Day 12** tests: MW action scarcity (one per day). Rescue vs. investigate vs. scout as a genuine three-way fork. Scholar pacing. The forecast system creating forward tension.

**Day 38** tests: Specialization consequences. The dependency drawer creating long-term pull. Mythic events as chapter breaks. Multiple simultaneous forks from system collisions.

**Day 71** tests: Knowledge as the real endgame. The final push as a knowledge gamble. Character death as narrative weight. The cost of paths not taken.

## Open Questions These Scenarios Expose

- [ ] What is the exact starting roster composition? (Scenario assumes 4/3/2/6/3/2 — is this right?)
- [ ] How many days of food do you start with?
- [ ] How does the "lost person" rescue mechanic work exactly? Random chance or event-triggered?
- [ ] Can the monastery grow beyond 20? (Scenario shows 21-22 — is this intended or should 20 be a hard cap?)
- [ ] How many days does an expedition to Ring 2 or Ring 3 take?
- [ ] When a character dies on an expedition, is the death immediate or do you learn about it when they return?
- [ ] What is the exact flow of the final assault? Is it a single encounter or a multi-day siege?
