# The Organism

The monastery is not a base. It is a living thing.

## The Metaphor

Every system in the game maps to an organ in a single organism. The player is the mind of that organism — deciding where to direct attention, what to prioritize, what to sacrifice. The organism has limited cells (people), limited energy (sacred bandwidth, food, materials), and limited awareness (perception bandwidth). It cannot grow indefinitely. It can only become more capable through understanding.

## The Organs

### The Senses — Mist Walkers
How the monastery perceives the world. The only way information enters the system. Without senses, the organism is blind.

### The Brain — Scholars
How the monastery interprets what it perceives. Converts raw discovery into usable knowledge, capabilities, and forecasts. Without the brain, perception is noise.

### The Immune System — Priests
How the monastery resists entropy. Holds the perimeter, enables operations in the mist, performs sacred rites. The baseline cost of existing. Without the immune system, the organism dies.

### The Muscles — Soldiers & Engineers
How the monastery acts on the world. Combat, construction, breaching, trapping, digging. Without muscles, the organism cannot execute what the brain decides.

### The Metabolism — Workers
How the monastery sustains itself. Food, wood, stone, metal. The material flow that keeps everything else functioning. Without metabolism, the organism starves.

## The Fundamental Constraint

There are approximately 20 people. That number barely changes. Every person is an organ. Losing one doesn't just reduce a number — it removes a function. The organism doesn't shrink. It becomes disabled.

This is why attachment forms. This is why loss hurts. This is why efficiency matters — because doing more with the same people is the only way to grow.

## The Heartbeat

The organism has a rhythm: contract and expand.

- **Contract:** Pull everyone in. Stabilize. Heal. Build. This is safety, but also stagnation.
- **Expand:** Send people out. Explore. Fight. Discover. This is growth, but also vulnerability.

The monastery is most vulnerable when it is most ambitious. Every mission is the organism reaching an arm into the mist and hoping nothing bites it off.

This oscillation IS the tension described in the North Star. It should be felt in every phase of the game.

## How Systems Connect

All organs draw from the same pool of 20 people. This means every system competes with every other system for the same scarce resource: human labor and attention.

- A priest on the perimeter is a priest NOT on a mission
- A scholar decoding a clue is a scholar NOT forecasting threats
- An engineer building traps is an engineer NOT digging underground
- A worker farming is a worker NOT assisting a dig
- A Mist Walker exploring is a Mist Walker NOT rescuing someone lost in the mist

The game is the constant rebalancing of this organism's limited cells across competing needs. That's where agency lives.
