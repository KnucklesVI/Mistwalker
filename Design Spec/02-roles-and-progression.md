# Roles & Progression

## The Six Roles

The monastery has exactly six roles. No more. Depth comes from progression, transformation, and itemization — not from adding new role types.

### 1. Priest
The immune system. Generates sacred bandwidth — the spiritual energy that holds the mist at bay. Maintains the perimeter barrier. Creates mission bubbles that allow others to travel in the mist. Performs sacred rites (resurrection, sanctification). The most critical role in the early game. A monastery without priests dies.

### 2. Engineer
The builder. Constructs traps, fortifications, and infrastructure. Digs underground to excavate ancient facilities. Breaches sealed locations and barriers. Crafts items and maintains equipment. Competes with himself — time building traps is time NOT digging.

### 3. Soldier
The defender and striker. Fights raids, escorts expeditions, protects the base. The monastery's capacity for violence. Without soldiers, the monastery cannot act on what it knows.

### 4. Worker
The backbone. Farms food, harvests wood, mines stone and metal. Assists engineers on digs and construction. Provides the raw material flow that keeps everything else running. Unglamorous but essential — if workers stop, everything stops.

### 5. Scholar
The brain. Deciphers clues to reveal locations. Decodes lore and discoveries. Forecasts upcoming threats. Converts raw materials into compounds and counters. Unlocks transformations for other roles. The scholar's importance scales with the game — marginal early, absolutely critical mid-to-late.

### 6. Mist Walker
The senses. The ONLY way information enters the monastery. Explores the mist for clues, locations, and discoveries. Rescues people lost in the mist. Scouts incoming threats for tactical advantage. **Permanent commitment** — once someone becomes a Mist Walker, they cannot change back. This is the game's defining fork. One MW is pre-committed at game start. Additional MWs require deliberate player investment.

## Starting Roster

**4 Priests / 4 Soldiers / 1 Engineer / 5 Workers / 1 Scholar / 1 Mist Walker / 4 Unassigned = 20**

The MW is pre-committed — the perception pipeline is live from Day 1. The 4 unassigned people are the player's first identity decisions. Bare minimum growth roles (1 engineer, 1 scholar) means earning a second of either feels like an investment, not a given.

## The Progression Model

Every character progresses through three tiers, regardless of role.

### Tier 1: Novice
Starting state. Competent but unremarkable. Learning the basics of their role. Lower efficiency, higher failure rates, more vulnerable. Can handle physical mist threats only.

### Tier 2: Veteran
Earned through sustained work in their role (XP from active duty) AND a defining moment (milestone gate). A veteran has adapted to the current mist tier — including corruption if active. Purely quantitative at baseline — same things, done better. Veterans are the reliable backbone.

**Promotion requires both:**
- Accumulated XP from active role duty (~15-20 days of active work)
- A role-specific milestone (see below)

### Veteran Milestone Gates

These are the defining moments that open the door to veteran status. They are NOT quests the player assigns — they emerge from play. A priest doesn't "go on vigil duty"; they end up holding the wall alone because the player made a choice that pulled others away, and they survived.

**These are first-draft triggers, explicitly designed to be tuned through playtesting.** The goal is that milestones fire naturally within the XP window (~15-20 days) for a character who is being actively used. Neither XP nor milestone should be the bottleneck most of the time.

**Priest — The Vigil.** Hold the perimeter during a crisis with reduced coverage — when another priest is lost, pulled for training, or sent on expedition. The moment the novice held the line alone and it didn't break.

**Engineer — The Breakthrough.** Complete a significant construction or excavation — a new facility, a deep dig level, or a field fortification. The moment the engineer built something that changed what the monastery could do.

**Soldier — The Stand.** Survive a raid where casualties occurred, or strike the killing blow on a notable enemy. The moment the soldier proved they could hold when it mattered.

**Worker — The Surplus.** Deliver a critical resource at a critical moment — a harvest that prevented famine, a haul that enabled a key construction, an output spike that saved a plan. The moment the worker's labor visibly mattered.

**Scholar — The Decode.** Successfully interpret a discovery that was sealed or stuck — a Dependency Drawer item, or a mist nature identification the monastery desperately needed. The moment the scholar's mind changed the game.

**Mist Walker — The Return.** Come back from an expedition that went badly wrong — deep ring, low health, lost companions, extended time in hostile mist. The moment the MW walked into the mist and shouldn't have come back, but did.

### Tier 3: Elevated
The qualitative leap. Elevation means the character has transcended the standard path. This is where specialization happens — an elevated scholar becomes an Apothecary, Cartographer, or Ritualist. Elevation unlocks new capabilities, not just better numbers.

**Elevation is a fork.** The player chooses which specialization path. This choice is permanent and defines what that character can do for the rest of the run. Different specializations serve different strategies.

**Elevation requires three things:**

1. **Veteran status.** The character must already be a veteran in their role.
2. **Scholar research (one-time unlock).** A scholar must research the specific specialization path — "what does it take for a veteran soldier to become a Bulwark?" This is a research task that takes time and goes through the knowledge pipeline. Once researched, that path is unlocked permanently for the whole monastery. Any qualifying veteran can now choose it. The scholar only does this once per specialization.
3. **Catalyst or facility (per-character cost).** The actual elevation of a specific veteran requires a catalyst — a ritual space, tome, crafted item, or facility appropriate to the role. This is consumed or occupied per elevation. The player can't elevate everyone simultaneously even if all paths are unlocked.

Elevation may also draw **Source Attention** — performing the elevation rite is a high-value action with a transparent, pre-stated penalty. The player weighs whether now is the right time.

This connects to the underground: some facilities needed for elevation may be buried. A Delver who excavates an ancient Training Hall unlocks the physical space soldiers need for their rite. An Alchemical Chamber enables scholar elevations. Digging isn't just about loot — it's infrastructure that enables growth.

## Mist Nature Adaptation

Mist natures (crystalline, darkness, glorious, decay, etc.) are drawn from a **randomized pool** each run. There is no fixed progression — each ring introduces a different nature, and the player must discover what it is through the knowledge pipeline before priests can prepare.

### How Priests Adapt

Priests don't automatically gain mist nature resistance through leveling. Instead:

1. **MW scouts the next ring** and brings back clues about its nature
2. **Scholars decode** what the nature is and research the specific counter
3. **Priests come off the wall** to study the counter — they cannot learn it while maintaining the perimeter
4. **After training**, a priest can hold back that nature permanently — the ability stacks with any previous natures they've learned

A priest who has learned to counter Crystalline and Darkness can hold back both simultaneously. By late game, experienced priests may handle standard mist plus two or three secondary natures. This makes veteran and elevated priests irreplaceable — their value isn't just bigger numbers, it's broader coverage.

### The Vulnerability Window

Every time a new ring is opened, the monastery faces a temporary crisis: some priests must leave the wall to train, reducing perimeter coverage exactly when a new threat is arriving. More priests, more scholars, and better MW intelligence all compress this window, but it never disappears entirely. This is a core tension driver.

### Specializations Are Beyond Nature Handling

Priest specializations (Shepherd, Oathkeeper, Chanter) provide capabilities BEYOND holding the perimeter against mist natures. Nature adaptation is the baseline job. Specializations are about what a priest does on top of that.

## Intrinsic Stats: Body, Mind, Spirit

Every character has three intrinsic stats that are mostly fixed:
- **Body** — Physical capability, endurance, carrying capacity
- **Mind** — Analysis, learning speed, pattern recognition
- **Spirit** — Willpower, sacred affinity, mist resistance

These don't change through normal leveling. They CAN be permanently altered by:
- Rare tomes
- Artifact binding
- Mythic events
- Surviving extreme mist exposure
- Resurrection side effects

A boosted intrinsic stat can open paths that standard specialization can't. A soldier with extraordinary Mind might develop Watcher-like perception through a non-standard transformation. A worker with boosted Spirit might access rites normally reserved for priests. These are the off-menu items that emerge from play.

## Role Switching

Anyone can switch roles at any tier. Switching resets the character to novice in the new role. However, previous role progress is **frozen, not erased** — switching back restores their prior tier, specialization, and elevation. The character always retains their name, non-standard transformations, intrinsic stats, and personal history.

Intrinsic stat boosts carry across roles naturally. A worker with high Body who switches to soldier benefits from that physical capability in their new role. A scholar with boosted Mind who switches to priest learns nature counters faster. Stats don't care what uniform you're wearing.

Mist Walker is the one role that can NEVER be left. Once committed, permanent.

Switching is costly but not destructive. It exists for desperate moments — your last priest died and someone must hold the perimeter, even badly — with the safety net that their old role isn't gone forever if they can eventually switch back.

## Specialization Paths

The following are the **standard** specialization paths — the known options available at elevation. They are not a hard cap. Additional specializations can emerge through non-standard transformations, intrinsic stat boosts, cross-role training, itemization, or mythic events. The standard three per role are the floor, not the ceiling. Part of the game's fun is discovering a rare, unique class and figuring out how to play it.

### Priest Specializations

**The Shepherd** — Specializes in protection beyond the perimeter. Creates stronger mission bubbles, making expeditions safer. Can project sacred bandwidth to distant teams, reducing casualties on multi-day missions. The priest who goes WITH the team.
- **Tradeoff:** Not on the perimeter while shielding an expedition.
- **Serves:** Tension (base exposed when Shepherd is away), Efficiency (safer expeditions = fewer losses)

**The Oathkeeper** — Specializes in rites and resurrection. Faster, cheaper resurrection with fewer side effects. Performs sanctification rites that permanently strengthen a location or person. Creates binding oaths between characters that grant paired bonuses.
- **Tradeoff:** About recovery and bonding, not prevention. Doesn't stop bad things from happening.
- **Serves:** Attachment (character bonds), Agency (resurrection decisions), Wonder (sanctification transformations)

**The Chanter** — Specializes in amplifying others. Prayers boost the effectiveness of everyone around them — soldiers fight harder, workers produce more, scholars decode faster — but only while the Chanter is actively praying. A force multiplier.
- **Tradeoff:** The Chanter does nothing except boost others. If they die, everyone drops back to baseline.
- **Serves:** Efficiency (more from fewer), Tension (dependency on one person), Attachment (the Chanter becomes essential)

### Engineer Specializations

**The Delver** — Specializes in underground excavation. Digs faster, finds more per level, can identify chamber contents before breaking through. The monastery's archaeology accelerator.
- **Tradeoff:** Underground. Not building traps or surface infrastructure. Betting on what's buried.
- **Serves:** Wonder (what's down there?), Comprehension (ancient knowledge)

**The Ashwright** — Specializes in crafting and construction. Builds superior traps, constructs facilities faster, can upgrade existing facilities to higher tiers. Better infrastructure, period.
- **Tradeoff:** Doesn't dig. Needs steady material supply. An Ashwright without materials is an expensive novice.
- **Serves:** Efficiency (better tools), Agency (choose what to build)

**The Breacher** — Specializes in opening sealed locations, constructing forward camps, and expedition engineering. Cracks open what others can't. Builds mobile defenses for field teams.
- **Tradeoff:** Nothing they do helps at home. The base doesn't benefit — only expeditions do.
- **Serves:** Wonder (what's behind the seal?), Comprehension (accessing locked knowledge)

### Soldier Specializations

**The Bulwark** — Immovable defense. Reduces ALL damage the monastery takes during raids. Can protect adjacent characters from death by absorbing the hit. The human shield.
- **Tradeoff:** Purely defensive. Doesn't improve expeditions. Stays home.
- **Serves:** Attachment (protects others), Tension (one person between the monastery and disaster)

**The Watcher** — Flips all combat encounters to offense-first. Every fight resolves as your attack vs their defense. Soldiers, traps, and positioning always favor you.
- **Tradeoff:** Lower raw combat stats. The advantage is structural, not numerical.
- **Serves:** Efficiency (every encounter favorable), Comprehension (reads the battlefield)

**The Vanguard** — Field commander. Improves effectiveness of everyone on their expedition team. Scholars decode faster, engineers dig better, workers carry more. Handles threats before they become distractions.
- **Tradeoff:** Bonus only works in the field. At home, a Vanguard is just a veteran soldier.
- **Serves:** Efficiency (team multiplier), Agency (which team gets the Vanguard?)

### Worker Specializations

**The Packer** — Heavy hauler. Brings back metals, relics, and heavy materials from conquered locations that no one else can carry. Extends expedition capacity.
- **Tradeoff:** Out in the field, not producing at home. Expedition days = lost production.
- **Serves:** Comprehension (bring back the artifacts), Efficiency (nothing left behind)

**The Rootwalker** — Herb finder and cultivator. Finds rare botanical/alchemical materials on expeditions. Cultivates herbs at the monastery, creating renewable supply. Feeds the Apothecary pipeline.
- **Tradeoff:** Cultivation takes time. Works at the mist edge, dangerous if perimeter drops.
- **Serves:** Efficiency (renewable resources), Wonder (what grows out here?)

**The Tinker** — Practical problem-noticer. While doing normal work, occasionally generates "practical insights" that speed up scholar research, give engineers ideas, or reveal shortcuts. Not book-smart — problem-smart.
- **Tradeoff:** Lower raw production. Always tinkering instead of just working.
- **Serves:** Wonder (unexpected discoveries), Comprehension (a different kind of intelligence)

### Mist Walker: No Standard Specializations

The MW has no standard specialization menu. They are already the most committed, most unique role. Their identity emerges entirely from:
- **Lived experience** — What happened to them in the mist shapes who they become
- **Itemization** — Tomes, artifacts, and relics bound to the MW grant specific capabilities
- **Non-standard transformations** — Surviving extreme events, encountering unknown elements, deep mist exposure

A MW who repeatedly explores Ring 1 becomes different from one who pushes into Ring 2 early. A MW who rescues people develops differently from one who scouts threats. Their story IS their specialization.

### Mist Walker Progression

While the MW has no specialization tree, they DO progress in concrete ways:

**Endurance.** The MW's capacity to stay out in the mist increases over time. Early game, Ring 1 scouting is a full day's work. A veteran MW can push further, stay longer, and scout deeper rings without as much risk. Endurance gates how far and how long the MW can operate.

**Combat — Offense and Defense.** The MW gets better at fighting. Not soldier-level, but enough to handle minor location encounters alone and survive ambushes that would kill a novice. Offense lets them clear threats without needing a full expedition. Defense keeps them alive when things go wrong.

**Random Effects from Experience.** The MW accumulates unique capabilities from what they encounter in the mist. These are not chosen — they happen. Surviving a crystalline storm might grant mist-sight in crystalline rings. Escaping a darkness ambush might grant heightened awareness. Each MW becomes a product of what they lived through. No two MWs develop the same way across runs.

## Non-Standard Transformations

Beyond the specialization menu, characters can gain **unique traits** from lived experience. These cannot be planned for. They emerge from play.

**Triggers include:**
- Surviving being lost in the mist
- Being resurrected (may come back changed)
- Binding to a specific artifact or tome
- Witnessing or participating in a mythic event
- Completing a particularly dangerous mission
- Exposure to unknown elements underground
- Intrinsic stat boost from rare items (Body/Mind/Spirit)

**These may grant:**
- A new ability no one else has
- A title reflecting what happened (Gandalf-style naming)
- A hidden capability that wasn't on any menu
- A permanent change (positive, negative, or both)
