# Crafting & Facilities

The crafting system is the connective tissue between resources, scholars, and capability. It turns raw materials into tools, compounds, catalysts, and infrastructure. It connects combat (creature essences) to scholarship (recipe discovery) to defense (nature counters) to growth (elevation catalysts).

## Design Principles

**No bookkeeping.** The player assigns people to facilities, not individual recipes. A scholar assigned to the Alchemical Chamber works on whatever the highest-priority compound is. The player makes strategic decisions — which facility gets staffed, who works there, what's the priority — but doesn't micromanage each crafting action.

**Recipes are discovered, not known.** The monastery starts with only basic recipes. Everything else comes through the knowledge pipeline — a scholar studies a relic or lore text and unlocks a recipe permanently. The recipe list grows as scholars uncover more.

**Facilities gate crafting.** No facility, no crafting in that category. Engineers build them. Some are discovered underground. This creates infrastructure dependencies — stockpiling materials without the right room is useless.

## Material Categories

### 1. Organics
Food, herbs, botanical materials. Workers harvest these daily.

**Food** is consumed daily — it's the survival baseline. If food runs out, everything collapses. Food supply is the worker's most fundamental contribution.

**Herbs** are the specialty organic material. Rootwalkers cultivate renewable herb sources. Herbs feed the Apothecary pipeline for compounds and nature counters. Perishable, renewable, always in demand.

### 2. Stone & Wood
Basic construction materials. Workers extract these. Engineers consume them for buildings, traps, fortifications, and dig supports.

This is infrastructure fuel. Always needed, never exciting, which is the point — it's the backbone that everything else is built on. Steady supply enables everything; disrupted supply stalls everything.

### 3. Metal
Rare and heavy. Found at conquered locations, hauled back by Packers. **Cannot be harvested at the monastery** — you have to go get it.

Used for high-tier construction, equipment, and some elevation catalysts. Metal is the bottleneck material that forces expeditions. You can turtle on food, wood, and stone. You cannot turtle on metal. This is one of the systems that pushes the player outward.

### 4. Essences
Extracted from mist creature corpses, mist samples brought back by MWs, and certain underground deposits.

**Nature-specific:** a Crystalline Essence is different from a Darkness Essence. Scholars use these to synthesize nature counters, craft specialized compounds, and create tools attuned to specific mist types.

Essences are the material that connects combat (killing creatures) to scholarship (making compounds) to defense (priest counters). The mist nature system becomes tangible through essences. Soldiers and MWs generate the raw supply. Scholars convert it. Priests consume the output.

### 5. Relics
Tomes, artifacts, sealed objects, ancient texts. Found through exploration and underground excavation.

**NOT consumed in bulk** — each one is unique or semi-unique. Scholars study them to unlock recipes, transformation paths, elevation knowledge, Source intelligence, and mist nature information. Some can be bound to characters for permanent effects (especially MWs).

Relics are the knowledge pipeline's physical currency. Finding a relic is finding a question. Studying it is finding an answer.

## Facilities

Crafting requires facilities. No facility, no crafting in that category.

### Tier 1 — Basic (Buildable from Day 1)
Built by engineers with standard materials (stone, wood). Any worker or engineer can staff them. Output scales with the operator's tier — a veteran at the Forge produces better results than a novice.

**Workshop** — Basic tool creation, repairs, simple trap components. The starter facility. Keeps equipment functional.

**Storehouse** — Food preservation, material storage. Reduces spoilage, increases carrying capacity. A passive facility — staffing it improves efficiency but it functions at a baseline without a dedicated operator.

**Forge** — Basic metalwork, equipment production. Requires metal supply. A worker can operate it for basic output; an engineer gets better results.

### Tier 2 — Advanced (Requires Research + Resources)
Built by engineers with more resources, or discovered underground. Requires a specific role to operate effectively. A wrong-role operator can do basic tasks at reduced efficiency, but full capability requires the right person.

**Alchemical Chamber** — Essence processing, compound synthesis, nature counter creation. Requires a scholar to operate. An Apothecary gets significant bonuses. This is where essences become usable.

**Herbarium** — Herb cultivation, botanical research. Requires a worker (ideally a Rootwalker). Turns herbs from a field-dependent resource into a renewable one.

**Advanced Forge** — High-tier metalwork, relic component processing, equipment upgrades. Requires an engineer. An Ashwright gets bonuses. Consumes more metal but produces significantly better output.

### Tier 3 — Specialized (Requires Veteran+ Operator)
Built with significant investment, often requiring underground excavation. Requires a veteran or elevated character of the right role to operate. May draw **Source Attention** when first activated.

**Ritual Sanctum** — Elevation rites, sanctification, resurrection support. Requires a priest (ideally an Oathkeeper). This is where elevation happens for most roles.

**Deep Forge** — Masterwork equipment, relic-bound items, catalyst creation. Requires an Ashwright or veteran engineer.

**Ancient Facilities** — Discovered underground, not built. Pre-existing rooms from whatever civilization came before. More powerful than constructed equivalents but can't be relocated or duplicated. Each one is unique and may serve purposes no constructed facility can replicate. The Delver's specialty is finding and activating these.

### Staffing Rules

**Tier 1:** Any worker or engineer can staff. Output scales with tier.

**Tier 2:** Requires the right role for full capability. Wrong-role operators can do basic tasks at reduced output. The right specialization (Apothecary in the Alchemical Chamber, Rootwalker in the Herbarium, Ashwright at the Advanced Forge) gets meaningful bonuses.

**Tier 3:** Requires a veteran or elevated character of the correct role. No fallback — you can't put a novice worker in the Ritual Sanctum.

**Staffing IS a resource decision.** A scholar in the Alchemical Chamber is a scholar NOT decoding clues. An Ashwright running the Deep Forge is an engineer NOT building traps. The player constantly chooses: which facility gets the skilled person today?

## Recipe System

### Discovery
Recipes are unlocked through the knowledge pipeline. A scholar studies a relic or lore text → recipe is permanently available. The monastery starts with only basic recipes (bandages, simple food preservation, rudimentary tools/traps).

### Structure
A recipe combines materials from 2-3 categories + requires a specific facility. Examples (illustrative, not final):

**Basic (available from start):**
- Bandages = Organics (herbs) + Workshop
- Simple Trap = Stone/Wood + Workshop
- Preserved Rations = Organics (food) + Storehouse

**Discovered:**
- Nature Counter Compound = Essence (matching nature) + Herbs + Alchemical Chamber
- Elevation Catalyst = Metal + Relic component + role-specific facility
- Equipment Upgrade = Metal + Scholar research + Advanced Forge
- Mist Ward = Essence + Spirit-attuned herbs + Ritual Sanctum

### Priority Queue
When a facility is staffed, the operator works through a priority queue set by the player. When a recipe completes, a notification fires. If a choice is needed (which compound to synthesize next), the game prompts. Otherwise the queue advances automatically.

The goal: crafting feels like managing a department, not operating a vending machine.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Full recipe list (requires mist nature pool to be defined first)
- [ ] Exact material costs for facility construction
- [ ] How long does each recipe take to complete?
- [ ] Can multiple operators staff the same facility for faster output?
- [ ] What specific ancient facilities exist underground?
- [ ] Which recipes/activations carry Source Attention costs?
- [ ] How does the Tinker's "practical insight" interact with crafting? (Speed boost? Recipe hints?)
- [ ] Can recipes fail? Should there be a quality variance based on operator skill?
