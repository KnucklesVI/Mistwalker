## The Six Words

The game's DNA. Every system, every mechanic, every line of code must serve at least one of these. If it doesn't, it doesn't belong.

**Comprehension** — You are a mind trying to understand a world that is actively trying to erase you. The mist is ignorance. Everything you do — exploring, decoding, digging — is an act of understanding. The game's central question is always: *do you know enough yet?*

**Wonder** — What pulls you deeper. The moment you crack open a sealed chamber and find something that changes what's possible. The first time a priest performs a rite that didn't exist before. Wonder is the game saying "the world is bigger and stranger than you thought." Without wonder, comprehension is just homework.

**Efficiency** — What makes you feel clever. The satisfaction of holding the perimeter with three priests instead of five, freeing two souls for something that matters. A system clicking into place. Efficiency is the game rewarding your intelligence. Without it, the monastery is just suffering.

**Agency** — What makes it yours. The moment you look at two imperfect options and commit. Not because the game told you to, but because you read the situation and made a bet. Agency is the difference between "I did what I had to" and "I chose this." Without agency, everything else is autopilot.

**Attachment** — What gives everything weight. Twenty named people, not two hundred disposable units. The priest who was resurrected and came back different. The engineer you've relied on for 80 days. Without attachment, loss is a number going down. With it, loss is a story.

**Tension** — What makes the whole thing breathe. Not constant stress — that's exhausting. The oscillation between tight and release. The base is exposed while the expedition is out. They come home. You exhale. You push again. Without tension, everything else loses its stakes.

## One-Sentence Thesis

A fragile monastery where every decision is a bet — you're spending scarce attention and labor to sequence knowledge fast enough to outpace entropy.

## What This Game Is

- A stewardship game about a fixed community under pressure
- A knowledge game where information is the rarest resource
- A gambling game where skilled play improves odds but luck still matters
- A wonder game where discoveries change what's possible, not just what's stronger
- A 2-4 hour roguelike where losing is expected, instructive, and fun

## What This Game Is Not

- A growth simulator where you outscale the threat
- An optimization puzzle with one correct solution
- A stat-stacking RPG where numbers define identity
- A feature showcase — every system must serve the six words

## The Run in Four Sentences

You stabilize a fragile monastery against the mist while your Mist Walker begins to perceive the world beyond. You learn what threats are coming and transform your people to meet them, making hard choices about who becomes what. You commit to pushing deeper, gambling on whether your comprehension is sufficient, discovering things that reshape your monastery's identity. You face the source of the mist with whatever knowledge and capability you assembled — and it's either enough, or it isn't.

## The Player's Mantra

*Stabilize. Learn. Adapt. Plan. Act. Commit.*
