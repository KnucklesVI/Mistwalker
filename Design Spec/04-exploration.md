# Exploration

The monastery has two axes of exploration. Both consume labor. Both reveal the unknown. But they feel fundamentally different.

Rings are about the Mist Walker going outward alone into danger — perception and risk. The underground is about the Engineer working steadily downward with monastery support — infrastructure and investment. Rings are fast, dangerous, and information-rich. The underground is slow, resource-hungry, and capability-rich.

For the underground axis, see **[17 — The Underground](17-the-underground.md)**.

## Axis 1: Outward — The Rings

The mist-shrouded world is organized into concentric rings of increasing danger. Each ring carries a unique mist nature drawn from a randomized pool (see Doc 03). The player does not know what nature a ring contains until the MW scouts it and scholars decode the clues.

### Ring 1 — The Shallows
Standard mist only. No secondary nature. The tutorial ring. Tests whether the monastery can survive at all. Contains basic clues, herbs, materials, and the first locations. Relatively safe for MW scouting. The player learns how exploration, locations, and the knowledge pipeline work here.

### Ring 2 — Standard + [Nature A]
The first secondary nature appears. Physical defenses may lose effectiveness depending on the nature. Requires the adaptation cycle: MW scouts nature → scholars decode → priests train. Tests whether the monastery can adapt to the unknown. The locations here are harder and more rewarding.

### Ring 3 — Standard + [Nature A] + [Nature B]
A different nature stacks on top of Ring 2's. The perimeter now holds three layers. Tests whether the monastery has truly comprehended the mist and built the depth to handle compounding threats. The path to Ring 4 starts here.

### Ring 4 — Standard + [Nature A] + [Nature B] + [Source Nature]
The Source's domain. Its own unique nature, different from Rings 2 and 3. The Source must be found through exploration here — it doesn't reveal itself. The ultimate test of everything the player has built. The perimeter holds four layers while the player searches for and prepares the final assault.

### Rings as Permission Checks, Not Hard Gates
The player CAN push into a deeper ring before they're ready. It's survivable — but brutally costly. Prepared monasteries pay less in blood. Unprepared ones bleed. This preserves agency: the player can gamble.

## Locations

Every ring contains locations — places of significance hidden in the mist. There are two types: **vital locations** and **minor locations**.

### Vital Locations (3 Per Ring)

Rings 1-3 each contain exactly **3 vital locations**. Ring 4 contains **1 vital location** — the Source's lair — but it is significantly deeper and more dangerous than any other (see Ring 4 below). That's **10 vital locations total**, each with a piece of the puzzle.

**Vital locations are drawn from a pool, not fixed.** Which three appear in each ring is randomized per run. The pool is large enough that no two runs feel identical, but each individual location is hand-designed with distinct identity, encounters, and rewards.

**Finding vital locations requires map fragments.** The MW brings back pieces of a map — not knowledge clues, but physical cartographic data. Enough fragments and the vital location is revealed on the map. This is different from the Source clues found INSIDE the location. Map fragments tell you WHERE it is. Source clues tell you WHAT you need to know about the enemy.

#### The Three-Tier Structure

Each vital location is a **three-tier mini-dungeon**, not a single encounter. Clearing a vital location is a multi-day campaign.

**Tier 1 — The Approach.** The exterior. The MW can scout this in a single day of action. Scouting reveals what's guarding the location, the mist nature flavor of the defenders, and possibly a hint of what's inside. The player sees the risk profile and decides: is this worth committing a full expedition team?

Tier 1 has its own defenders (creatures flavored by the ring's mist nature) and at least one reward — materials, a minor relic, herbs, or useful equipment. Even if the player never pushes deeper, Tier 1 has value.

**Tier 2 — The Chamber.** Below the surface. Pushing in requires a committed expedition: MW, soldiers for combat, possibly a Breacher for sealed sections. This is another day of action. New defenders, harder than Tier 1. A more significant reward — a relic, a recipe-unlocking text, crafting materials, a facility blueprint.

After clearing Tier 2, the player decides: push to the bottom, or take what we have and pull back?

**Tier 3 — The Heart.** The deepest level. This is where the **essential Source clue** lives, along with the most valuable reward. But by now the expedition has committed 3+ days of travel, priest bubble maintenance, soldier escort, and MW attention. If the team is at the edge of the priest's bubble range, they may not have the coverage to survive. If the defenders are too strong, the team may need to retreat and come back with a better composition.

**A failed push doesn't destroy the location.** The team can retreat from any tier, recover at the monastery, and return later with better preparation. Tier 1 and Tier 2 rewards that were already claimed stay claimed. The location remembers what's been cleared. This means a vital location can be a multi-trip strategic objective — scout it on Day 15, clear Tier 1 on Day 18, push Tier 2 on Day 22, come back for the Heart on Day 30 after training a Breacher.

#### Ring 4 — The Source's Lair

Ring 4 has only **one vital location** — but it breaks the standard three-tier mold. The Source's lair has a **randomized depth**: it could be 4, 5, 6, or more tiers deep. The player doesn't know how far it goes until they're inside.

This means final assault planning is uncertain even with complete Source intelligence. You might prepare for four tiers and discover a sixth. Each tier follows the same pattern — defenders, rewards, a decision to push or retreat — but the scale is larger, the defenders are tuned to Ring 4's unique mist nature, and the stakes are existential.

The Source itself waits at the bottom. Everything above it is the gauntlet.

Ring 4 still has minor locations scattered throughout, just like other rings. The MW must explore Ring 4 to find map fragments, scout threats, and discover minor locations while searching for the Source's lair.

#### Source Clues

The clues found in Tier 3 of vital locations are **puzzles, not instructions**. They don't say "the Source is weak to silver." They provide fragments that require scholar interpretation, cross-referencing with other clues, and study.

A single clue might be cryptic — a mural depicting a ritual, a text in an ancient language, a physical artifact that radiates in a specific pattern. Two clues from different locations start making sense together. Three clues and a skilled scholar can decode something actionable: a Source weakness, a phase transition trigger, a counter-mechanic.

The clues are real and deducible — not arbitrary obscurity. A patient player who invests in scholarship will solve them. A player who rushes the final assault with incomplete knowledge will face a harder fight with more unknowns.

### Minor Locations (Random, Persistent, Revisitable)

Beyond the vital locations, each ring is populated with **minor locations** — random points of interest drawn from a larger pool. These appear unpredictably during MW exploration.

Minor locations are **single-tier encounters, not multi-tier dungeons**. A blessing pool. A skull wall. A collapsed shrine. A mist-touched grove. A merchant camp. An abandoned outpost.

**Minor locations persist on the map.** When the MW discovers one, it appears in the MW's exploration view as a visible, named place. The MW can attempt it immediately — but if it's too dangerous for the MW alone (guarded by creatures, requiring combat the MW can't handle), the player can **send an expedition team back later**. The location doesn't vanish. It waits.

This means minor locations serve double duty: they're discoveries during MW scouting AND potential expedition targets for the full team. A minor location the MW spotted on Day 8 might become a worthwhile side mission on Day 25 when you have soldiers to spare.

**What they offer varies wildly:**
- A blessing that buffs a character permanently
- A curse that debuffs or transforms
- A resource cache (herbs, metal, essences)
- A lore fragment that feeds the knowledge pipeline
- A lost person who can be rescued (population growth)
- An environmental hazard that damages the MW
- Atmospheric flavor — something memorable but not mechanically impactful
- Nothing useful at all

Minor locations are the **texture of the world**. They make each run feel different even beyond the vital location randomization. Some are wonderful. Some are dangerous. Some are just... places in the mist. They serve Wonder (what will I find today?) and keep MW scouting interesting even when the player isn't specifically hunting map fragments.

## Expedition Mechanics

### Duration

Expeditions are **multi-day commitments**, especially for vital locations.

**MW scouting:** Same-day for Ring 1. Multi-day for Ring 2+ (travel time increases with distance). The MW returns to the monastery after each action unless they choose to camp in the field (riskier but saves travel time on subsequent days).

**Full expeditions to vital locations:** Minimum 3 days for the three tiers, plus travel time. A Ring 3 vital location might take 5-7 days total: travel out, clear three tiers, travel back. During this entire time, every expedition member is away from the monastery.

**Minor location encounters:** The MW can attempt them during a daily action. If too dangerous, they persist on the map and an expedition team can return later.

### Expedition Composition

A full expedition team for a vital location typically needs:
- **Mist Walker** — navigation and scouting (required)
- **Soldiers** — combat (required for Tier 2+)
- **Priest (Shepherd ideal)** — bubble maintenance for multi-day trips (required for Ring 2+)
- **Engineer (Breacher ideal)** — for sealed sections (situational)
- **Worker (Packer ideal)** — for hauling back heavy rewards (situational)

This creates a significant manpower pull. A deep expedition team of 4-5 people is 15-25% of the monastery's population gone for almost a week. The surface operations suffer.

### The Range Problem

Priest bubbles have limited duration and range. Deeper rings require either:
- A **Shepherd** who can project sacred bandwidth farther
- Multiple priests maintaining a chain of bubbles
- Accepting higher risk with thinner protection

If a location's Tier 3 is at the edge of bubble range, the team may not have enough protection to survive the Heart encounter AND get home safely. This creates the strategic tension of "we can reach it, but can we get back?" and drives the decision to retreat, resupply, and return.

## The Competition Between Axes

Outward and downward exploration compete for the same people. Engineers building traps or digging underground can't do both. Workers assisting a dig can't farm food. Soldiers can guard the perimeter, escort an expedition, OR provide interior security during digs — never all three.

This is a strategic fork: do you push outward for Source clues and combat resources, or dig downward for permanent infrastructure and transformation tomes? The "right" answer depends on the run.
