# The Underground

The underground is the monastery's second axis of exploration. The rings push outward through the mist. The underground pushes downward through stone and history. Both yield discoveries, but the rhythm is completely different.

Rings are about the Mist Walker going out alone into danger — perception and risk. The underground is about the Engineer working steadily downward with monastery support — infrastructure and investment. Rings are fast, dangerous, and information-rich. The underground is slow, resource-hungry, and capability-rich.

## Structure

The underground sits directly below the monastery. It is a vertical dig — not a sprawling dungeon. Each level is deeper, harder to reach, and more rewarding.

There are **4 defined levels**, each with 2-3 discoverable chambers. Below Level 4 lies **The Abyss** — an open-ended, unpredictable depth with no map and no guarantees.

---

## The Defined Levels

### Level 1 — The Foundation

Just below the monastery. Relatively safe to excavate. The remnants of whatever the monastery was built on top of — old storerooms, collapsed workshops, a water source, basic infrastructure from a previous era.

**What you find:** Upgraded basic facilities (a better forge, a larger storehouse), simple relics, building materials. Nothing game-changing, but everything useful.

**Purpose:** Teaches the player that digging pays off. Low risk, moderate reward. Establishes the pattern: invest engineer time → get infrastructure.

**Requirements:** Any engineer can dig here. Basic materials (stone, wood) for supports.

### Level 2 — The Old Halls

Deeper. Requires more engineering effort and materials. The architecture changes — this wasn't just a foundation. Someone built things down here deliberately. Halls, chambers with purpose. Sealed doors start appearing.

**What you find:** Advanced facilities — the Alchemical Chamber, a Training Hall, a library archive with sealed relics. This is where the real mid-game infrastructure lives. Elevation catalysts, recipe-unlocking relics, lore texts about the mist.

**Purpose:** Enables the mid-game power spike. The player who invests in digging gets access to elevation, advanced crafting, and knowledge that surface exploration alone can't provide. The player who ignores the underground is playing with a smaller toolkit.

**Requirements:** Veteran engineer or significant materials investment. Some chambers are sealed (Breacher needed). Some contents require scholar interpretation before they're usable.

### Level 3 — The Sealed Depths

Deep enough that the architecture is clearly ancient and alien. The builders were not the same people who built the monastery. The purpose of these rooms is not immediately obvious. Some are trapped. Some are flooded. Some contain things that probably should have stayed buried.

**What you find:** Unique ancient facilities that can't be built on the surface — things with no modern equivalent. Purpose-built rooms from a civilization that understood the mist (or created it). Relics that reveal Source weaknesses. Transformation catalysts. Equipment that can't be crafted.

**Purpose:** Late-game capability that surface play alone cannot match. The underground starts asking questions: who built this? Why is it here? What were they doing? This feeds Wonder and Comprehension simultaneously.

**Requirements:** Breacher or veteran engineer minimum. Significant resource investment. Some chambers may draw Source Attention when opened. Clues from the Cartographer can reveal hidden chambers that would otherwise be missed.

### Level 4 — The Root

The deepest defined level. Connected to the mist in some way — the mist seeps in from below as well as from outside. The boundary between stone and something else becomes unclear. The air is wrong. Characters who spend too long here may be changed.

**What you find:** Information critical to understanding the Source. Possibly the only place to find certain relics needed for the final assault. Ancient records of what the Source actually is. The builders' last records — their warnings, their failures, their final attempts.

**Purpose:** The underground's payoff for the endgame. A player who digs to Level 4 understands the Source better than one who only explored the rings. The knowledge here compresses the final assault preparation — fewer unknowns, better counters, clearer strategy.

**Requirements:** Delver specialization strongly recommended. Significant Source Attention when breaching. Characters may gain non-standard transformations from exposure. The risk is real — this is not a safe dig.

## The Abyss (Below Level 4)

Below the four defined levels, there is more. The Delver can keep digging. But past Level 4, there is **no map, no structure, no guarantee.**

### What It Is

The Abyss is an open-ended, unpredictable dig space. Each attempt to go deeper is a gamble. The player doesn't know what they'll find — if anything. There are no defined chambers, no expected rewards, no knowable risk profile.

### What You Might Find

**Glorious outcomes:** A relic that fundamentally changes the run. An ancient facility of impossible power. A direct revelation about the Source that makes the final assault trivial. A transformation catalyst that creates a class no one has ever seen. The stuff of legends.

**Catastrophic outcomes:** A breach that lets the mist in from below — now the perimeter faces pressure from two directions. A creature that was sealed down here for a reason. A collapse that injures or kills the dig team. A corruption that permanently changes the Delver. An awakening that draws the Source's full attention.

**Nothing:** Stone. Days of wasted engineer time. The abyss doesn't always pay.

### How It Works

Each abyss dig attempt takes multiple days and significant resources. The outcome is resolved when the dig completes — success, failure, or discovery. Unlike normal Source Attention actions, **the abyss does not state its cost transparently.** The player is told: "Digging deeper is unpredictable. The consequences are unknown." This is the one place in the game where the cost/benefit analysis is genuinely blind.

Only a Delver can attempt the abyss without near-certain collapse. Even a Delver faces significant risk. This is their late-game identity — the monastery's gambler, the person you send into the unknown when you're desperate or ambitious enough to roll the dice.

### Design Intent

The abyss serves **Wonder** (what's down there?), **Tension** (should we risk it?), and **Agency** (the player chooses to go deeper when nothing requires them to). It's the ultimate expression of the game's exploration philosophy: the world rewards curiosity, but curiosity has teeth.

The abyss is NOT required to win. A player can beat the Source without ever digging past Level 4. The abyss is for the player who wants more — more risk, more reward, more story. It's the optional hard mode that creates memorable runs.

## Dig Mechanics

### How Digging Works

An engineer is assigned to dig. They consume stone and wood for supports. Each level takes multiple days to excavate. Progress is visible — the player can see how far along the current dig is.

When the engineer breaks through to a chamber, its contents are revealed. But not all chambers are obvious:

- **Hidden chambers** require clues to identify. A Cartographer who has studied underground texts can reveal chambers that a standard dig would miss entirely.
- **Sealed chambers** require a Breacher to open. A standard engineer can dig around them but can't access what's inside.
- **Trapped chambers** may damage the dig team on breakthrough. Scouting (via scholar analysis of architectural clues) can identify traps before they trigger.
- **Flooded chambers** require engineering solutions before they're usable. They take longer to clear but the contents are often well-preserved.

### Dig Speed and Cost

Deeper levels take longer and cost more materials:

- **Level 1:** Days to dig, basic materials. Any engineer.
- **Level 2:** Longer, more materials. Veteran engineer recommended.
- **Level 3:** Significantly longer, heavy resource investment. Breacher or veteran engineer.
- **Level 4:** Major time and resource commitment. Delver strongly recommended. Source Attention on breakthrough.
- **Abyss:** Variable time, heavy resources, unpredictable outcomes. Delver required.

Exact numbers are playtest-tunable.

### Dig Team

The primary operator is always an engineer. Workers can assist to speed things up by hauling materials and clearing rubble. Scholars can optionally help by identifying chamber contents or detecting traps before breakthrough — but this is a bonus, not a requirement.

### Underground Threats and Monastery Risk

The underground is not a separate place. It is directly below the monastery. If something dangerous is released during a dig — a sealed creature, mist seepage, a trapped chamber — **it is loose inside the monastery.**

This means EVERYONE in the monastery is at risk from a bad dig, not just the dig team. The scholar working in the Alchemical Chamber. The engineer at the forge. The worker in the storehouse. The priest recovering in the infirmary. Anyone who is not a soldier is a potential casualty.

**Soldiers stationed at the monastery are the defense against underground threats.** Their job isn't to escort the dig team — it's to respond when something breaks loose below. Without soldiers at home, a catastrophic dig outcome could kill irreplaceable non-combatants.

**The fork:** Deep digs (Level 3+) carry real risk of releasing something dangerous. Do you keep enough soldiers at home to handle an underground breach? Or do you send them on expeditions and gamble that the dig goes cleanly? At Level 1, this barely matters. At Level 3+, it's a genuine decision. In the Abyss, it's existential.

This creates a three-way pull on soldiers: perimeter defense against raids, expedition escort, and monastery interior security during digs. There are never enough soldiers for all three.

## Connection to Other Systems

**Exploration:** The underground is the second axis. Rings go out, digs go down. Both feed the knowledge pipeline. Both yield relics, lore, and discoveries. The player must balance investment in both.

**Crafting & Facilities:** The underground is where advanced and ancient facilities live. Without digging, the monastery's crafting capability has a ceiling. The Alchemical Chamber, Training Hall, Deep Forge, and unique ancient facilities are all underground rewards.

**Elevation:** Some elevation catalysts and facilities are only found underground. A monastery that doesn't dig can still elevate characters, but with fewer options and at greater material cost.

**Source Intelligence:** Level 4 contains critical information about the Source. A player who reaches Level 4 enters the final assault with better knowledge and more counter-options than one who only explored the rings.

**Source Attention:** Deep digs, especially at Level 3+, may draw Source Attention. Abyss digs have unpredictable attention costs. The monastery gets stronger from digging, but the Source notices the reaching.
