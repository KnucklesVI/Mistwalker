## Key Connections

### The Perception-Interpretation Loop
**MW → Scholars → Capability → Action**

This is the game's central pipeline. Everything else either feeds into it or depends on its output. If this loop stalls (no MW activity, no scholars working), the monastery stops evolving and the mist catches up.

### The Sacred Bandwidth Economy
**Priests generate → Perimeter + Missions + Rites consume**

Sacred bandwidth is zero-sum. Every priest-hour spent on the perimeter is a priest-hour NOT available for missions or rituals. The player constantly balances:
- How much perimeter is "enough"?
- Can I afford to send a priest on a mission?
- Is resurrection worth the bandwidth cost?

### The Labor Competition
**All 20 people compete for assignment across all systems**

Every system wants labor:
- Perimeter wants priests
- Exploration wants the MW + escorts
- Research wants scholars
- Construction wants engineers + workers
- Agriculture wants workers
- Defense wants soldiers

There are never enough people. This is the fundamental engine of agency — the player must prioritize.

### The Knowledge-Transformation Chain
**Discover → Decode → Unlock → Transform → New Capability**

The scholar doesn't just learn things for fun. Every piece of decoded knowledge potentially unlocks a transformation that changes what the monastery can do. This chain connects exploration directly to character progression.

### The Mist Clock vs. Preparation Race
**Mist escalates (automatic) vs. Monastery adapts (player-driven)**

The mist introduces new elements on a fixed clock. The monastery must discover, interpret, and implement counters before those elements arrive. This is the scaling war. The player who invests in the perception-interpretation loop has more warning. The player who doesn't gets blindsided.

### The Risk-Reward Oscillation
**Expansion (risky, informative) ↔ Contraction (safe, productive)**

Missions create vulnerability at home but gather information and resources. Returning home creates safety but pauses information gathering. The player rides this oscillation throughout the run.

## Feedback Loops

### Positive (Accelerating)
- Better scholars → faster decoding → more capability → better scholars (specialization)
- More discoveries → more transformations → stronger expeditions → more discoveries
- Better preparation → lower losses on missions → more people for preparation

### Negative (Stabilizing)
- Sending people out → base weakens → must pull people back → slower exploration
- Mist escalation → more bandwidth needed for perimeter → less bandwidth for missions
- Character death → capability gap → must compensate → slower progress

### Death Spiral (What We Must Prevent from Feeling Random)
- Priest dies → perimeter drops → more people exposed → more deaths → cascade

**Design rule:** Death spirals must originate from player decisions (overextension, underinvestment, bad gamble). They must NEVER originate from pure RNG on a stable base. If the player is doing everything "right" and still death spirals, the game is broken.

## System Dependency Summary

| System | Depends On | Feeds Into |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Mist Walker | Available person (permanent) | Scholar pipeline, all knowledge |
| Scholars | MW discoveries, materials, facilities | Transformations, forecasts, compounds |
| Priests | Sacred bandwidth | Perimeter, mission bubbles, rites |
| Soldiers | Training, equipment | Defense, expedition combat |
| Engineers | Materials, workers | Traps, infrastructure, digging |
| Workers | Food production | Material flow, dig assistance |
| Exploration (out) | MW + team + priest bubble | Clues, locations, artifacts, lore |
| Exploration (down) | Engineers + workers | Facilities, tomes, ancient tech |
| Mist clock | Nothing (automatic) | Threat escalation, element introduction |
